					<h3>Overview</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="category-content">
					<p class="my-4">
						Tippt is a platform that scores restaurants based on their
						sustainability level. It aims to help customers make greener choices
						when purchasing take outs from restaurants and other food places
						(bar, cafe, etc). My official role is UX/UI Designer, but I also
						help out with branding, social media, and front end development.
					</p>
					<p class="my-4">
						Nellie Spektor, the founder, had the initial idea of creating a
						platform where users can search for food places that offer take out
						by their sustainability score. Throughout the summer, we aimed to
						consult with our target audience to ground the platform and
						experience in user research.

						Aligning the Visual Identity with Tippt’s Mission &amp; Values

					<p class="my-4">
						When I first started working on Tippt, the first thing I proposed
						was a logo redesign. I noticed that the current icon and logos
						needed a revamp to better showcase Tippt’s mission and values. The
						colours also needed to be refined to become web accessible. I had a
						short conversation with Nellie to understand the identity she wants
						to depict with Tippt. She wanted to have imagery that represents
						food, sustainability, and take out. She wanted to use blue and
						green, taken from her original logo, in order to portray
						sustainability, earth, and eco-friendliness. *The photo below
						displays Tippt’s Brand Guide used for branding and marketing
						purposes. There is a separate guide for the design system and web
						usage.

					<h3>Grounding the Experience in User Research</h3>

					<h4 class="uppercase text-lg font-medium">User Consultation</h4>
					<p class="my-4">
						We created survey asking about the participants’ ordering/take out
						and sustainability habits. This allowed us to get better understand
						the user’s benefit sought would be from the Tippt platform. It also
						helped us figure out who Tippt’s main target audience should be
						(based on each age group’s habits and outlook). We received 219
						survey responses, and at least 30 participants were interviewed for
						follow up questions.
					</p>
					<p class="my-4">
						After doing the survey and interviews, we mapped out the answers to
						questions about their influences, current steps taken to be more
						sustainable, sources of information, barriers to being more
						sustainable, effects of COVID-19 on their take out habits, as well
						as their opinions on ratings/reviews.
					</p>
					<p class="my-4">
						I conducted a design sprint where the team and I brainstormed
						categorized sticky notes and created opportunities – solutions to
						the issues. We generated an extensive list, but we decided to refine
						it into a shorter list for MVP. (Note: the list below was refined
						further during a later MVP meeting, the list is available further
						down this case study!)
					</p>
					<ol class="list-decimal pl-4 my-4">
						<li>View contact info of restaurants</li>
						<li>Assess the restaurant’s packaging</li>
						<li>Sustainability tips before going to a restaurant</li>
						<li>Reminder to leave a review</li>
						<li>Offer incentives to leave reviews.</li>
						<li>
							Show information about what they can do for each restaurant (i.e
							this restaurant accepts reusables!)
						</li>
						<li>Add photos to a review</li>
						<li>See tippt-provided information</li>
						<li>
							Leave a review based on their packaging and accomodations
							(reusables, allergies, substitutions, etc.)
						</li>
						<li>Create account</li>
						<li>Search restaurants</li>

					<h4 class="uppercase text-lg font-medium">Personas</h4>
					<p class="my-4">
						I conducted a design sprint with the whole team to get everyone’s
						perspectives in analyzing the user research and creating personas.
						Together, we brainstormed the different user groups and their
						demographic and psychographic characteristics. My fellow UX
						designer, Mina, and I took our final results from the design sprint
						and created more refined user personas.
